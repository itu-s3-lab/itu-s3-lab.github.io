The S続 (Smart Space Sensing and Systems) Laboratory is a research group dedicated to advancing knowledge and technological innovation, with a strong commitment to teaching and cutting-edge research.

Our educational philosophy is founded on **Project-based Learning**, a methodological approach that immerses students in practical, hands-on experiences.
This model enables the acquisition of advanced technical skills and problem-solving capabilities through the development of real-world projects, bridging the gap between academic theory and industrial application.

Our research activities focus on the intersection of intelligent systems and sustainable technologies, exploring innovative solutions for future challenges.
Our areas of specialization include:
*   **EdgeAI** and **Intelligent Systems and Sensors**: We develop artificial intelligence algorithms optimized for execution on low-power devices and design sensors capable of autonomously perceiving and interpreting the environment.
*   **Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN)** and **Low-Power IoT**: We study efficient communication architectures and protocols to ensure the connectivity and sustainability of large-scale distributed systems.
*   **Embedded Systems** and **Energy Harvesting**: Our research extends to foundational technologies, such as the design of embedded systems and the development of energy harvesting techniques to create fully self-powered smart devices.
*   **Autonomous Robots**: We design and develop autonomous robots for complex scenarios and industrial applications.

The S続 Lab is part of the [Interdisciplinary Transformation University of Austria (IT:U)](https://it-u.at/en/){:target="_blank"}, contributing to its mission of interdisciplinary transformation.
